Since August 2022, I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of
Technology, Kharagpur, India. I work in Gravitational Physics under the supervision of
[Prof. Sayan Kar](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1003662?ui-citation-summary=true).

The focus of my current research is in the field of Gravity, where one searches for
systems such as regular black holes, wormholes, and other singularity-free solutions 
via solving Einstein's field equation with some exotic or regular matter sources and 
studies of their different observable properties.

I completed my M.Sc. at the  Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, 
where I worked on black hole shadows of static, spherically symmetric and stationary, axisymmetric
metrics, which are solutions in some alternative theories of gravity. 

I care about promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science. In my free time, you will
find me reading story books or playing a videogame.
