we know theoretically that solutions in Einstein's General Relativity (GR) often include singularities. Spacetime singularities in Einstein's General Relativity are neither outcomes of highly symmetrical solutions nor coordinate artefacts; rather, they signify the constraints of classical GR and are inevitable. Solving this puzzle is crucial to understanding the final outcome of the gravitational collapse of initially stable structures. 

Overview
======
Regular black holes are recognised as possible options for non-singular solutions. In Figure, a typical static, spherically symmetric regular black hole is presented. It is clear that regular black holes replace the singularity point of the vacuum BHs in Einstein's GR with a 'regular core'. In 1968, Bardeen first introduced a static spherically symmetric regular black hole spacetime. The initial suggestion for the source of a Bardeen-type black hole involved the utilisation of a nonlinear electric or magnetic monopole.<img src='/images/RBH.jpeg' width='50%' height='50%'>
