we know theoretically that solutions in Einstein's General Relativity (GR) often include singularities. Spacetime singularities in Einstein's General Relativity are neither outcomes of highly symmetrical solutions nor coordinate artefacts; rather, they signify the constraints of classical GR and are inevitable. Solving this puzzle is crucial to understanding the final outcome of the gravitational collapse of initially stable structures. Regular black holes may resolve this issue.
