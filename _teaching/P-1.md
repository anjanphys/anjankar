we know theoretically that solutions in Einstein's General Relativity (GR) often include singularities. Spacetime singularities in Einstein's General Relativity are neither outcomes of highly symmetrical solutions nor coordinate artefacts; rather, they signify the constraints of classical GR and are inevitable. Solving this puzzle is crucial to understanding the final outcome of the gravitational collapse of initially stable structures. 

Overview

Regular black holes are recognised as possible options for non-singular solutions. In Figure, a typical static, spherically symmetric regular black hole is presented. It is clear that regular black holes replace the singularity point of the vacuum BHs in Einstein's GR with a 'regular core'. In 1968, Bardeen first introduced a static spherically symmetric regular black hole spacetime. The initial suggestion for the source of a Bardeen-type black hole involved the utilisation of a nonlinear electric or magnetic monopole.


A New Proposal
======
$$ds^{2} = -\Big(1-\frac{b_{0}^{2}r^{2}}{(r^{2}+g^{2})^{2}}\Big)dt^{2} + \Big(1-\frac{b_{0}^{2}r^{2}}{(r^{2}+g^{2})^{2}}\Big)^{-1}dr^{2}  +r^{2}\Big(d\theta^{2}+\sin^{2}\theta d\phi^{2}\Big)$$
