Title: New regular black holes: geometry, matter sources and shadow profiles <br> <br>
A new two-parameter, static and spherically symmetric regular geometry is proposed, which, for
specific parameter choices, represents a geodesically complete, regular black hole. However, unlike
most regular black holes which have Schwarzschild spacetime as their singular limit, our spacetime
reduces to a singular, mutated Reissner–Nordstr ̈om geometry, for a particular choice of parameters.
The required matter (within the framework of General Relativity (GR)) violates the energy con-
ditions, but not in the entire domain of the radial coordinate. Despite energy condition violation,
we are able to construct a viable source for our geometry, which involves a nonlinear magnetic
monopole in a chosen version of nonlinear electrodynamics. An alternative source in braneworld
gravity is also suggested. Further, we obtain the shadow profile for our geometry and try to
estimate the metric parameters using recent observational results from the EHT collaboration
